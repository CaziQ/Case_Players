<div> Invest Bank PSC v El-Husseini & Ors [2023] EWCA Civ 555 </br>
</div>
</body>

	<p>A fascinating case linking insolvency, company and property laws.</p>
	<p>The court has wide powers to prevent creditors being defrauded: transactions at an undervalue can be challenged under section 423 Insolvency Act 1986 even if the debtor is not a party to a transaction or does not have a beneficial interest in the relevant assets. 
Debtors therefore cannot use corporate structures to avoid their creditors. </p>
<p> Two issues of law were considered by the Court of Appeal in this casee in relation to section 423:</br></p>
<p> (1) whether a transfer to a third party by a company owned and controlled by a debtor can be challenged as defrauding creditors; (the Bank's appeal) and</p> 
<p> (2) whether there can be a transaction at an undervalue if the debtor does not have a beneficial interest in the asset which is the subject of the 'transaction' (the Defendants' appeal).</p>
