</div>



	<p>A fascinating case linking insolvency, company and property laws.</p>
	<p>The court has wide powers to prevent creditors being defrauded: 
	transactions at undervalue can be challenged under section 423 even if the debtor is not 
	party to a transaction or does not have a beneficial interest in the relevant assets. 
	Debtors therefore cannot use corporate structures to avoid their creditors. </p>

	<p>Unlike transactions at an undervalue in corporate insolvency <b>(section 238) </b> and 
	bankruptcy <b>(section 339)</b>, <b>section 423</b> is not confined to the insolvency context. It has a wider application.</p>
	<p>Two issues of law were considered by the Court of Appeal in this case in relation to <b>section 423:</b></p>
	<p>(1) whether a transfer to a third party by a company owned and controlled by a debtor can be challenged as defrauding creditors (the Bank’s appeal); and
	</p><p>(2) whether there can be a “transaction” at an undervalue if the debtor does not have a beneficial 
	interest in the asset that is the subject of the “transaction” (the Respondents’ appeal).</p>
